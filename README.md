# Awesome Drug Map

## Project Summary

*Your project documentation should be between 3 and 5 pages long and explain the following questions*

### What were your initial considerations on the user group, the use of it?

 - Item 1
 - Item 2
 - Item 3

### Which data did you choose? By which criteria?

 - After an inital search on the topic open drug data, we found two good sources for data:
 - [EMCDDA for Europe](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/2014)
 - [SAMHSA for the US](http://oas.samhsa.gov/states.cfm)
 - Another piece of data that was considered to be used as a source were the findings of the [Global Drug Survey](http://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/). However, as their survey is voluntary, this source was discarded as it is not representative.
 - The European data source from the EMCDDA is a comprehensive collection of interesting data not limited to the prevalence of drug use but also including topics like overdose deaths, seizures, prices and purity of drugs.
 - For our application, only the prevalence of drug use was chosen to be used as we wanted to focus on the usage of drugs.
 - The data on drug usage includes a wide range of different substances from which we chose to visualize cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines, alcohol and cigarettes. Those drugs were chosen as some of them are comporable to the data gathered from the US while the others were selected out of interest.
 - The data is available to be exported as CSV and Excel files. Moreover, the data is available in the categories of lifetime, last year or last month prevalence and can be selected for different age grouphs like all adults (15-64), young adults (15-34) or aged 15-24 going up to aged 55-64. 
 - Data is provided for all EU states and some additional ones like Turkey although some may be missing data on selected drugs. Additional to the prevalence among males, females and the total population, the year of the data collection is given.
 - In order to use the data in our prototype, the CSV files were used and converted to JSON using [this](http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm) awesome tool. The JSON files were then processed using node.js and the parse.js script that can be found in the EU_parse_script directory which also includes the JSON files used. Finally, average values for all the different drug prevalences were calculated in order to be used to represent the whole EU. 
 - This was done in order to be comparable to the US which provided data for the nation as a whole as well as all states. Unfortunately, this data was provided as tables in plain HTML documents. Moreover, only data on cannabis, alcohol and cigarette usage was contained in those tables.
 - In order to get the data in a machine-readable form, for each year chosen (2009, 2006 and 2004) a separate JavaScript script was written as the tables were not consistent. Those scripts have to be executed on the HTML pages themselves (for example [this](http://oas.samhsa.gov/2k9State/WebOnlyTables/stateTabs.htm) for 2009). Those scripts can be found in the US_parse_scripts_and_data directory as well as the JSON files that were generated by them.
 - The different JSON files for the years 2009, 2006 and 2004 were then merged into a single JSON file which was combined with the European data to create the basis for our application. 
 - The data provided by SAMHSA included different age groups (12-17, 18-25, 26+ etc.) and total as well as percentile values for drug consumption. Using the data from different age groups and years, a comparable database could be created.

### Did you encounter difficulties?

 - The data for the US was only available as plain HTML tables or PDF documents. However, using some JavaScript and XPath it was possible to parse those HTML tables.
 - Item 2
 - Item 3

### Did you even have to change the project due to these difficulties/lacking data?

 - Item 1
 - Item 2
 - Item 3

### How did you realize your project?

 - Item 1
 - Item 2
 - Item 3

### Which languages, libraries, frameworks, tools did you use?

 - [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)
 - [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org)
 - [D3](http://d3js.org/)
 - [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson)

### Which considerations did you have in terms of design and interface?

**Your expierience in terms of searching data and using it are especially
valuable for me when I am in touch with data providers asking how they
can improve their service.**

- We tried to have a minimal design, so that the user can explore the drug data very easy.
- There are Icons, which display the different drugs.
- Every drug has their own color, so that you can see the differents between them.
- the easiest way to show the data was in a map, so we creaded an interactive world map
